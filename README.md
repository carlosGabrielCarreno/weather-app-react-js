## üå¶Ô∏è Weather App

### This weather app was a challenge I did in [SoyHenry](https://www.soyhenry.com/) Bootcamp, I loved making it as it helped me gain basic and fundamental skills with React JS, responsive design and CSS modules.

#

### Technologies used in the project: _React JS_, _CSS Modules_,_Git_ and _Netlify_ for deployment.
